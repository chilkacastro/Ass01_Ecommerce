    <h3>Project Proposal</h3>
    <p>A project proposal is a written document outlining everything stakeholders should know about a project, 
        including the timeline, budget, objectives, and goals. Your project proposal should summarize your 
        project details and sell your idea, so stakeholders<br>buy in to the initiative. For this specific project 
        the stakeholders are your teacher and your team and the timeline is outlined below in the grading scheme.
            You have to define your budgeted work hours, as well as objectives and goals. In teams of 2 you will<br> 
            write a Markdown document stored in your GitHub repository with the following contents:
            <ul>
                <li>Name of your team</li>
                <li>Name of the team members</li>
                <li>A description of the clientele, the general goal of the project, and a
                    list of all the features that will be supported by your final Web application. For each student in the 
                    team, there must be a total of 10 new features written. A new feature excludes the<br>features that were 
                    completely coded in class with your teacher, e.g. login, logout, registration, 2-factor authentication.</li>
                <li>An estimate of the number of hours you will spend implementing this Web application.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
